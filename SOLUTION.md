### Solution Description

The main part of the solution is implemented in the `GraphqlResolver` class, which provides methods to calculate the energy consumption of Bitcoin transactions, blocks, and wallets by interacting with the Blockchain API. Below is an explanation of the key components:

#### **Key Features**

1. **Energy Calculation Logic**:
   - The energy consumption is calculated based on the size of transactions in bytes, using a constant energy cost of `4.56 kWh` per byte.

2. **API Integration**:
   - The resolver interacts with the Blockchain API to fetch data about blocks, transactions, and wallets using endpoints like:
     - `https://blockchain.info/rawblock/{blockHash}` for block details.
     - `https://blockchain.info/rawtx/{txHash}` for transaction details.
     - `https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{address}` for wallet details.

3. **Concurrency Management**:
   - The `Sema` library is used to limit the number of concurrent API calls to avoid overwhelming the API and improve performance.

4. **Caching**:
   - A singleton pattern is implemented for the `GraphqlResolver` class to ensure that the `blockCache` is shared across all handler calls. This prevents redundant API calls and ensures that cached data persists across requests.

5. **Singleton Design**:
   - The `GraphqlResolver` class is implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance of the resolver exists. This allows the `blockCache` to be reused across all GraphQL queries.

#### **Methods Overview**

1. **`getBlockEnergyConsumption(blockHash: string)`**:
   - Fetches all transactions in a block and calculates the energy consumption for each transaction.
   - Uses the `blockCache` to avoid redundant API calls for previously fetched blocks.

2. **`getDailyEnergyConsumption(days: number)`**:
   - Calculates the total energy consumption and transaction count for blocks over a specified number of days.
   - Aggregates data from multiple blocks fetched for each day.
   - Uses concurrency control to limit the number of simultaneous API calls.

3. **`getWalletEnergyConsumption(address: string)`**:
   - Calculates the total energy consumption and transaction count for all transactions associated with a specific wallet address.

4. **`fetch(url: string)`**:
   - A low-level method to make HTTP GET requests using `axios`.
   - Includes logging to measure the time taken to fetch data from the API.

### Solution Performance Analysis

The solution leverages caching and concurrency control to optimize performance:
- **Caching**: The `blockCache` ensures that data for previously fetched blocks is reused, reducing redundant API calls.
- **Concurrency Control**: The `Sema` library limits the number of concurrent API calls, preventing the API from being overwhelmed.

#### **Conclusion**
The `GraphqlResolver` class is designed to efficiently calculate energy consumption for Bitcoin transactions, blocks, and wallets. By leveraging a singleton pattern, caching, and concurrency control, the solution ensures optimal performance and maintainability.
